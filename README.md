# Artificial-Life-with-Netlogo

Here we are write cide in netlogo for the termites to collect and flock


Model 1 “Collecting”: 
•	Pile formation of either green chips, blue chips or both.
•	The possibility for the user to put two circular patches of chosen size (radius) at chosen x, y coordinates .
•	This model can be built by adapting and extending NetLogo’s  “Termites” model.


Model 2 “Flocking”:
•	Grouping patterns formed by eight predefined sets of six parameter values (vision-angle, three vision distances, search-angle and exploration-option).
•	The user should have the opportunity to choose any of the eight sets when the model is running.  The chosen set of parameter values are immediately activated and  his enables a direct inspection of the effect of parameter values on the type of grouping pattern. 


Model 3 “Flocking with Collecting”:
•	This model should combine the features of models 1 and 2. The procedure “to collect” represents Model 1 and it should be possible to run this procedure on its own as well as in combination with the procedure “to flock” (= Model 2). The combined option should show turtles that perform collective behaviour while their movements are coordinated by a chosen set of “flocking” parameters.
